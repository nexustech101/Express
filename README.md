Express API Boilerplate
This is a simple boilerplate for building a RESTful API using Express.js.

Getting Started
Clone the repo: git clone https://github.com/yourusername/express-api-boilerplate.git
Install dependencies: npm install
Start the server: npm start
The API will now be accessible at http://localhost:3000.

API Routes
This boilerplate provides a basic route for testing the API:

GET /: Returns a welcome message.
You can add your own routes by creating new files in the routes/ directory.

Environment Variables
This boilerplate uses the dotenv package to load environment variables from a .env file. You can create your own .env file by copying the .env.example file and updating the values to match your environment.

Testing
This boilerplate uses the mocha and chai packages for testing. To run the tests, run the following command:

npm test
